My goal here is to Build a personal portfolio site from scratch, with focus on a mobile first design. take a peak at what i'v built [Live Demo](https://harlexkhal.github.io/Microverse-Porfolio-Website/). ðŸ˜Š

## Built With

- Lighthouse (An open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages. It has audits for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, SEO and more).
- Webhint (A customizable linting tool that helps you improve your site's accessibility, speed, cross-browser compatibility, and more by checking your code for best practices and common errors).
- Stylelint (A mighty, modern linter that helps you avoid errors and enforce conventions in your styles).

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites
The basic requirements for building the executable are:
* A working browser application (Google chrome, Mozilla Fire fox, Microsoft edge ...)
* VSCode or any other equivalent code editor
* Node Package Manager (For installing packages like Lighthous, webhint & stylelint used for checking for debugging bad codes before deployment)
